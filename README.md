Step by step guide for estimating volume of a vessel from a drawn profile using Adobe illustrator and Blender 2.76
Note that blender 2.8 has changes to interface not included here

Includes screenshots of menus and keyboard key presses needed.
For people completely new to blender some practice with interface will be helpful

Even though it looks a bit of a faff, when you get the hang of the steps and have the addons turned on it takes about 30 seconds.

Hope it's helpful to someone.
